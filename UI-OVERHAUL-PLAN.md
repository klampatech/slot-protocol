## Implementation Notes

### SVG Icon Approach
- Inline SVGs in HTML or JS-generated
- Consistent viewBox sizing (24×24 for UI, 16×16 for small)
- Use CSS variables for colors to support themes
- Animate with CSS or requestAnimationFrame

### Color Palette
```
Cyan:    #00fff2 (primary)
Magenta: #ff00ff (secondary)
Yellow:  #ffff00 (accent)
Green:   #00ff88 (success)
Red:     #ff2244 (danger/warning)
Orange:  #ff6600 (special)
Purple:  #9944ff (mystic)
White:   #ffffff (neutral)
Grey:    #444466 (dormant)
```
